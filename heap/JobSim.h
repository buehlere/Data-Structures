filename: JobSim.h
The file simulates job scheduling in an operating system. Jobs are generated at
random times. Each job is given both a random priority from 1 to 4, where 1 is
the highest priority and a random amount of time to complete its execution.
Jobs do not begin execution and run to completion, but instead share the
processor. The operating system  executes a job for a fixed unit of time called
a time slice. At the end of the time slice, the current jobâ€™s execution is
suspended. The job is then placed on a priority queue, where it
waits for its next share of processor time. The job having the highest
priority is then removed from the priority queue and executed for a time slice.
When a job is first generated, it will begin executing immediately if the
processor is free. Otherwise it will be
placed on the priority queue.
